<p> Hello, my project is about web parsing and scraping. <p>
<p> I parsed information from the native site biblusi.ge, it is a site where you can see all kinds of books,on their webpage only book's url,title,price and authors names are displayed,but some of the books don't have authors on them,i parsed everything besides authors names,i had hard time parsing it.In addition, all the information is saved in csv file. fi<p>
